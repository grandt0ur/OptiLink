# OptiLink
This is a Plugin I developed for the notetaking application Obsidian. The purpose of this plugin is to allow users to easily generate and manage MOCs automatically and intuitively using the tag system. This is done to increase user productivity and allow the user to spend more time focusing on taking notes instead of organizing their zettelkasten
